the patches now named .new.off (and thus ignored for now) came with the
latest minimyth2 patches, but at least some of them do not seem to work
(for instance the temperature was shown as 175 degrees celsius resulting
in emergency shutdown tries) - as a result i dropped them for now as
they also do not add any significant functionality - with the patches
the following additional kernel config options got dropped as well:

CONFIG_SUNXI_ADDR_MGT=y
CONFIG_SUNXI_SYS_INFO=m
CONFIG_DUMP_REG=m
CONFIG_DUMP_REG_MISC=m
